The height of a binary tree with 1 node is 0.

Explanation:
The height of a binary tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
A binary tree with only 1 node (the root) has no edges. Therefore, its height is 0.
If you are counting the number of levels (instead of edges), then:

The number of levels for a tree with 1 node is 1.
Summary:
Height: 
0
0 (based on edges).
Levels: 
1
1 (based on nodes).

so a binary tree of height h can have atmost : 2^(h+1) -1 nodes

0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2 -> 4
3 -> 8
4 -> 16
=> 2^5 -1 = 31
height = 4
level = 5
