initution:

when we write decimal to binary conversion what we do

we divide the number by 2 and store its remainder
again we divide it by 2 & store its remainder 
this process goes on till we get a 0 as the number
then at the end we reverse teh string we receive
-----
public class Main {

    static void binary_equi(int n)
    {
        if(n==0) return;

        binary_equi(n/2);
        System.out.print(n%2);
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        
        binary_equi(8);
    }
}
