Concept 1 : 
-----------

What is the max value for n to let you answer get accepted for Time Complexity : O(n)
max. value of n should be 10^7 not more than this.

for instance in this question, 1 <= n <= 10^15
https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-numbers/description/
so here on submitting the code of TC O(n) it will give TLE.


Concept 2:
----------

m1%n + m2%n = (m1+m2)%n

46%3 + 53%3 = (46 + 53) % 3
(1 + 2)%3 = 0
this is not always true
for instance here it is not.
